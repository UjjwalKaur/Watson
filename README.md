Watson is a no-nonsense AI personal assistant that takes your chaotic thoughts ("rants") and converts them into laser-focused task schedules, intelligently blocking out your calendar using Google Calendar API. Powered by the Groq API and LLaMA 3, it helps you stay on track with your professional and personal goalsâ€”whether it's launching a startup, 10x'ing your income, or hitting the gym.
